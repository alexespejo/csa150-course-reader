   Machine and assembly language are <mark>low-level languages</mark>, tied to a
   specific CPU's instruction set. In the mid-1950s, <strong>
    John Backus</strong

   <strong> language.</strong>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a>
   (or the <tt>FOR</tt>mula <tt>TRAN</tt>slator), allowed scientists and
   engineers to write their own programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>
   (the <tt>CO</tt>mmon <tt>B</tt>usiness <tt>O</tt>riented <tt>L</tt>anguage),
   allowed accountants and bankers to write programs using a vocabulary with
   which they were comfortable. In 1958, <strong>John McCarthy</strong> at MIT built
   a third high-level language named
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"> LISP</a>
   (the <tt>LIS</tt>t <tt>P</tt>rocessing Language) to help him with his
   research into artificial intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
   These three high-level languages allowed non-computer specialists to write
   their own programs, but they were not
   <strong>general-purpose</strong> languages; scientists could not use COBOL to
   write code for NASA, and accountants could not use FORTRAN.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960, the designers of FORTRAN, COBOL and LISP gathered together in Paris
   to remedy that, producing the
   <strong>Algo</strong>rithmic<strong>L</strong>anguage (<a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">ALGOL</a
   >). Modern languages derive much of their syntax and many core concepts from
   ALGOL.

   Many new languages followed rapidly in the next seven decades. Here are two:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>, the
    Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, was developed at Dartmouth
    University in 1964. The professors <strong>Kemeny</strong>
    and <strong>Kurtz</strong> wanted to teach programming to university students
    using the new, interactive, time-share computers. BASIC was later the first language
    available on micro-computers, implemented by Bill Gates for the Altair. Even
    later, in the 1990s, Microsoft introduced <strong>Visual Basic</strong>, a
    graphical version, popular in the business world.

    In 1972, the Swiss computer scientist
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">
     Nicholas Wirth</a
    >
    felt that BASIC was teaching students bad programming habits, so he created the
    popular teaching language
    <a
     target="_blank"
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)"
    >
     Pascal</a
    >, (named after the philosopher, Blaise Pascal). Strongly influenced by
    Algol, Pascal enforced structured programming techniques. It was the first
    programming language taught in most university computing programs until
    about 2000. Wirth later designed Modula, Oberon, and
    <a

     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)"
    >
     Ada</a
    >, a language still in wide use in avionics and in defense.

  </ul>
