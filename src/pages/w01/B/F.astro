   A Danish Ph.D. student at Cambridge University,
   <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong>, was heavily influenced by
   <tt>SIMULA</tt>. In 1980, working as a researcher at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, he
   began adding object-oriented features to <tt>C</tt>. This first version of
   what would later become C++, was named
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf"
    >C with Classes</a
   >.

  <p>
   Unlike <strong>idealistic</strong> languages that enforce "one true path" to programming
   Utopia, C++ is
   <strong>pragmatic</strong>. C++ is designed as a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf">
    multi-paradigm</a
   >
   <strong>language</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
   In C++ the object-oriented and the procedural programming styles are <strong
    >complementary</strong
   >, since you may find a use each approach. So, consider each paradigm or
   style a <strong>tool</strong> that you can pull out of your toolbox when needed,
   to apply the conceptual model that is most appropriate for the task at hand.
