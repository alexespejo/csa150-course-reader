   In the 1930s, <mark>Alan Turing</mark>
   (dramatized by Benedict Cumberbach in <i>The Imitation Game</i>),

    imagined
   </a>
   a <strong>universal computing machine</strong> which could store both its data,
   <strong>and</strong> its
   <mark>programs</mark> in memory. 1940s-era computers, such as the ENIAC, <strong
    >had no programs</strong
   > as such. Instead, they were <strong>hard-wired</strong> to perform specific
   calculations.

    Programming them
   </a>
   entailed rewiring their circuit cabinets, a process that could take several days.
  </p>
  <p>
   Turing's ideas were realized in 1946, when mathematician and physicist <mark
    >John Von Neumann</mark
   >
   <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture"
   >
    described
   </a>
   the first real <strong>stored program</strong> computer system, the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDVAC">EDVAC</a
   >, whose <strong>machine language</strong> instructions were stored in memory
   as a <strong>binary numeric code</strong>.

  </div>
  <p>
   To run a program on the <strong>EVAC</strong>, each instruction was <mark
    >fetched</mark
   > from memory by the CPU Control Unit (CU) and then stored in
   <strong>registers</strong> on the CPU. The instruction was then <mark
    >decoded</mark
   > and <mark>executed</mark> by the CPU's Arithmetic/Logic unit (ALU). Finally,
   the results were written back into memory where they could be examined. This sequence-read,
   decode, execute and store-is known as the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle">
    instruction cycle</a
   >; it's how every computer works.
