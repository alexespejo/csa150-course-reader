   C++ comes with a wide variety of built in numeric types. There are signed and
   unsigned <mark>integers</mark>
   in five different sizes, as well as three different sizes of
   <mark>floating-point</mark> (or real) numbers. In addition, the standard library
   contains a <mark>complex number</mark> class, and it is easy to create your own
   custom numeric types.

   <strong>Integers</strong> are whole numbers; the name is Latin, meaning "whole".
   Mathematical integers are infinite, but the C++ varieties are <strong
    >finite</strong
   >; each stored in a
   <strong>fixed region of memory</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sizes for C++ integers are: <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>,
   <tt>long</tt>, and <tt>long</tt>
   <tt>long</tt>. C++ <strong>does not</strong> specify an <strong
    >exact range</strong
   > or
   <strong>representation</strong> for the integers. Both are <mark
    >implementation dependent</mark
   >. Here are the rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Size <mark>cannot decrease</mark> as you move from
    <tt>short</tt> to <tt>int</tt> to <tt>long</tt>
    to <tt>long</tt>
    <tt>long</tt>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <tt>int</tt> must use at least <tt>2</tt> bytes (16 bits),
    <tt>long</tt> must use at least <tt>4</tt> bytes (32 bits), and <tt>long</tt
    >
    <tt>long</tt> must use at least
    <tt>8</tt> bytes of storage (64 bits).
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   On our platform, <tt>int</tt> is 32 bits, <tt>long</tt> and <tt>long</tt>
   <tt>long</tt> are both 64 bits. Other platforms have different limits. For instance,
   on the current version of Visual C++,
   <tt>long</tt> is 32 bits, just like the <tt>int</tt>.
