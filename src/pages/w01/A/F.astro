  <h1>The Build Process</h1>
  <p>
   Once you have written your source code, the <strong>build process</strong> turns
   that source code into an executable program. The build process involves several
   tools:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <mark>Preprocessor</mark>—performs text substitution on your source code.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Compiler</mark>—generates <strong>assembly code</strong> from the preprocessed
    source code.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Assembler</mark>—converts assembly code into <strong>object</strong> or
    <strong>native machine code</strong>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Linker</mark>—combines machine-code modules into an <strong
     >executable</strong
    > that runs.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Make</mark>—provides instructions for
    <strong>building</strong> each program.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Loader</mark>—reads the executable from disk into memory and starts it
    running.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Debugger</mark>—runs your program inside a controlled environment.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   A <strong>combination</strong> a C++ compiler, linker, assembler and libraries,
   is known as a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain">toolchain</a>. The
   toolchain we'll use for this course is the Linux GCC 9 toolchain. In an
   online IDE, like the one in these lessons, you just click the <b>Run</b> button
   to perform all the steps and run the executable. In lecture, you'll look at each
   of these steps in more detail.
