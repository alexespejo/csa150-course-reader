   On the first page of Dennis Ritchie's seminal programming book, <strong
    >The C Programming Language,
   </strong> he writes:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in
    it. The first program to write is the same for all languages:
   </p>
   <p>Print the words: <strong>hello, world</strong></p>
   <p>
    This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the
    program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find
    out where the output went. With these mechanical details mastered,
    everything else is comparatively easy.
   </p>

   </a>
   I'm sure his last sentence was <strong>somewhat</strong>
   tongue-in-cheek, but let's follow his example and look at a C++ version of "Hello
   World" by clicking the little "running-man" to your right to open the program
   in an online IDE. Leave it open for the next few pages.
