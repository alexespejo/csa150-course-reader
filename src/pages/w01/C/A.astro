   The <tt>hello</tt> program, which you saw earlier, doesn’t include many features
   you’d expect in a "real" program. To illustrate more of C++, let's consider the
   program named
   <tt><em>f2c</em></tt> which converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius.
  </p>
  <div class="flex">
   <p>
    This is an <strong>IPO</strong> or <strong>Input Processing Output</strong>
    program, typical of those that we'll be building in these first few weeks. A
    computer is an <strong>information processor</strong>; a <strong
     >Cuisinart</strong
    > for words, numbers and ideas. Instead of vegetables, you feed it <strong
     >input</strong
    >; raw numbers, facts, figures and symbols (<strong>data</strong>). Your
    computer program
    <strong>processes</strong> that data, and turns it into
    <strong>information</strong>: organized, meaningful and useful
    <strong>output</strong>.
   </p>

  </div>
  <strong>Every program</strong> is based on this fundamental concept: input data,
  process it and then produce (or output) some information.

 <Header>The IPO Pattern</Header>
 <p>
  The programs we'll be writing are console-mode, IPO programs. These are
  plain-text programs, which run inside your terminal, and follow this pattern:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <mark>prompt</mark> the user to enter some input
   <li>
    <mark>read</mark> the user's input, storing it in variables
    <li>
     <mark>process</mark> the input
     <li><mark>output</mark> the results</li>
     <h2>
      Here's an example:
      <h2>
       <img
        src={imageF2c}
        class="inlineCenter"
        alt="The f2c program dialog."
        title="The f2c program dialog."
       />

       <ul>
        <li>
         The <tt class="i">f2c</tt> program asks the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit.
         This is the <b>prompt</b>. Note that the prompt appears on the same
         line as the input and ends in a space, so that the input is nicely
         separated.
        </li>
        <li>
         The program stops and waits for the user to enter in some input and
         press
         <tt>ENTER</tt>. In this case, the user entered <tt>212</tt> for the temperature
         in Fahrenheit. The program reads the user input and stores it in a variable.
        </li>
        <li>
         Next, the program uses an <b>algorithm</b> to convert the Fahrenheit temperature
         into Celcius.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, it diplays the result on the console.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The screenshot above is called a <b>sample run</b>. It shows the input
        and output in the terminal or shell. Now, let's take a closer look at
        the <tt class="i">f2c</tt> program itself.
