  <p>Look at the hints I've supplied here, and give it a try.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    I have already written a portion of the function skeleton (or stub) for you.
    Since the function returns an <tt>int</tt>, you just need to create the <tt
     >result</tt
    > variable, initialize it to zero, and <tt>return</tt> it at the end of the function.
   </li>
   <li>
    Next, use the <strong>canonical classic</strong>
    <tt class="i">for</tt>
    loop (from the previous page) to process and retrieve every character in the
    string. You should <strong>memorize</strong> this pattern so that it is always
    at your fingertips when required.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, check the character to see if it is one of <tt>aeiou</tt>. If it
    is, then count it.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   After you've given it a try, come back here and watch the solution video.
