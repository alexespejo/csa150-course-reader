 <Header id="A">Introducing Loops</Header>

  <p class="firstLine">
   An old CS joke. Why did the Computer Science student starve to death in the
   shower? He was following the instructions on the bottle of shampoo. To really
   "get" the joke, you have to learn about <mark>iteration</mark>, a Computer
   Science term that means
   <mark>repeating</mark> a set of actions. Iteration is also called <strong
    >repetition</strong
   > or
   <strong>looping</strong>. The statements that are used in iteration are
   called <strong>loops</strong>. Let's start by comparing iteration to the <tt
    >if</tt
   > statement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both iteration and selection are <mark>flow-of-control</mark>
   statements; they control <strong>which</strong> code is executed inside your program.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Like the <tt>if</tt> statement, iteration is based upon evaluating a <i
     >Boolean</i
    >—<tt>true</tt>/<tt>false</tt>—condition, and then performing a set of
    actions if the test is <tt>true</tt>, and skipping them if it is <tt
     >false</tt
    >.
   </li>
   <li>
    Both loops and <tt>if</tt> statements have a <strong>condition part</strong
    >, (the test), and a <strong>body part</strong>, (the actions that are
    taken).
   </li>
  </ul>

   alt="Illustrating the difference between loops and if statements."

  <p>
   <strong>Selection</strong>
   works like the illustration on the left. Driving down a highway, you come to a
   rest stop pull off. When you leave, you rejoin the highway further down the road.
   Once you rejoin the highway, <mark>you have no opportunity to go back</mark>,
   and revisit the rest stop again. Those who bypass the turnoff, skip the rest
   stop altogether.
  </p>
  <p>
   A loop looks similar, <mark>but it not the same</mark>. The illustration on
   the right shows that there is still a test, but, after you've had your break,
   the exit road "<mark>loops back</mark>" (hence the name), and you rejoin the
   highway where you initially left it. If you like, you can choose to enter the
   rest stop once again, even though the highway is one-way. In this sense, a
   loop works a little like a cloverleaf interchange.
