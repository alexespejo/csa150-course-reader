  <h1>The Standard Streams</h1>
 </Header>

  <p class="firstLine">
   At the lowest level, all input and output is a
   <mark>stream of bytes</mark> flowing through your program. The bytes may come
   from a file, your keyboard or even from some remote computer on the network. Your
   program looks at the stream and changes it, consumes it, or sends it on to output.

   />
  </p>
  <p>
   Programs that process streams of characters are called <strong>text</strong>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)">
    <strong>filters</strong></a
   >.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you run a program,
   <strong>where</strong> do the input bytes <strong>come from</strong> and where
   do the <strong>output bytes go to</strong>? What is the data source (in the
   illustration above), and what is the data destination? Before your program
   starts, the <mark>operating system</mark> automatically opens three <mark
    >standard</mark
   > streams:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li><tt>stdin</tt> (standard input)</li>
   <li><tt>stdout</tt> (standard output)</li>
   <li><tt>stderr</tt> (standard error)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   In C++, the built-in streams are used to initialize the <tt>cin</tt>,
   <tt>cout</tt> and <tt>cerr</tt> I/O objects. Java does the same thing, but uses
   them to initialize the <tt>System.in</tt>, <tt>System.out</tt>, and <tt
    >System.err</tt
   > objects. Python uses the streams directly.
  </p>
  <p>
   The operating system <strong>connects these streams</strong> to your console (screen
   and keyboard). But, <mark>before</mark> you
   <mark>run your program</mark>, you may ask the OS to connect each stream to a
   different endpoint. This is known as <mark>redirection</mark>.
