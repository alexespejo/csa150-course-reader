  <p class="firstLine">
   <mark>Input redirection</mark> allows you to run a program, and have that program
   get its input from a file or device, instead of from the keyboard. Your program
   doesn't need to change at all; it still reads from <tt>cin</tt> as always.
  </p>
  <p>
   To see how input redirection works, first, open the file named
   <tt>input.txt</tt> by clicking its tab, so you can see what it contains. Then,
   type this command in the shell:
  </p>
  <div class="consoleDisplay width-90">
   $ <tt class="t">cat &lt; input.txt</tt>
  </div>
  <p>
   The <strong>input redirection symbol</strong>
   <tt>&lt;</tt> asks the operating system to first open <tt>input.txt</tt> and then
   to connect that to the <strong>standard input</strong> stream. Now, <tt
    >cat</tt
   >
   gets its input <strong>from the file</strong> instead of from the keyboard.
  </p>
  <div class="consoleDisplay width-90">
   $ <tt class="t">cat &lt; input.txt</tt><br />
   <tt class="b"
    >This is text stored in "input.txt".<br />
    A second line in input.txt<br /></tt
   >
   $
  </div>
  <p>
   When all of the data has been processed, the prompt returns. (I've colored
   the output so that the input you type appears in teal, and the output from
   the command appears in blue.)
  </p>
