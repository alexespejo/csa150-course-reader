  <h1>The Fencepost Algorithm</h1>
 </Header><div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   To print an array, you want to surround all of the elements with delimiters
   (for instance brackets <tt>[]</tt>
   or braces <tt>&lbrace;&rbrace;</tt>), and <strong
    >separate the elements</strong
   > from each other by a comma. This is called the <strong
    >fencepost algorithm</strong
   >.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here's the algorithm, assuming you have selected values for the opening and
   closing delimiters as well as the size.
  </p>
  <pre
   class="pcode">Print opening delimiter (, &lbrace;, [, etc.
If array size is {'>'} 0 Then
	Print first element
	For every remaining element
		Print separator
		Print element
Print closing delimiter</pre>
