  <h1>Saving an Image</h1>
 </Header><div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   When we save the image, we can <mark>use a different format</mark> from the original.
   For instance, <b>JPEG</b> doesn't have transparent colors, but we can write the
   image back out as a <b>PNG</b>, which does. The <tt class="i"
    >stb_image_write</tt
   >
   library has different functions for each image type. Here's the code to save our
   image as <b>PNG</b>.
  </p>
  <pre
   class="language-cpp"><code>stbi_write_png("pete.png", width, height, channels, pete,
        width * channels);</code></pre>
  <p>
   Each file type you want to use has its own function, but the first five
   arguments are the same for each file type:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    The file name as a C-style string. Here we've hard-coded <tt>pete.png</tt>
   </li>
   <li>
    The <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt> returned from <tt class="i"
     >stbi_load()</tt
    >.
   </li>
   <li>
    The number of channels (or bytes-per-pixel) used in memory to represent the
    image.
   </li>
   <li>The pointer to the first byte of the image data in memory.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   The last argument, <tt>width</tt>
   <tt>*</tt>
   <tt>channels</tt>, is unique to <b>PNG</b> files. It tells the function at what
   byte the next row begins.
  </p>
  <h2>Freeing the Memory</h2>
  <p>
   The <tt class="i">stbi_load()</tt> function returns a pointer, but inside that
   function it asks the operating system to
   <mark>allocate enough memory</mark> to hold the image that it loads from disk.
   This memory is <strong>on the heap</strong>, which you met in an earlier
   lesson. In the C programming language, you have to remember to <strong
    >free</strong
   > that memory before your program ends. We do that by using the function
   <tt class="i">stbi_image_free(pete)</tt>.
  </p>
