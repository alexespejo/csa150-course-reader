   A pointer is variable that contains the address of another variable. In
   languages like Java, C# and Python, pointers are
   <mark>hidden</mark>
   from the programmer, and used only by the runtime system. In C++, understanding
   pointers is necessary for understanding how C++ programs work.
  </p>
  <p>
   An expression that refers to an object in memory is an
   <strong><em>lvalue</em></strong>. Variables are
   <strong><em>lvalues</em></strong> because you can store data in them. A named
   constant is a <strong
    >non-modifiable
    <em>lvalue</em></strong
   >. Many values in C++ <strong>are not</strong>
   <strong><em>lvalues</em></strong>; the result of an expression <strong
    >is a temporary value</strong
   >, but it
   <strong>is not</strong> an <strong><em>lvalue</em></strong>, because you
   cannot assign a new value it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following properties apply to modifiable
   <strong><em>lvalues</em></strong> in C++:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Every <strong><em>lvalue</em></strong> is stored somewhere in memory; thus it
    <strong>has an address</strong>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>The address of an</strong>
    <strong><em>lvalue</em></strong>
    <strong>never changes</strong>, even though the contents of those memory
    locations may change.
   </li>
   <li>
    The address of an <strong><em>lvalue</em></strong> is a
    <mark>pointer or address value</mark>, which can be stored in memory and
    manipulated as data.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To store an address value in memory, you create a
   <mark>pointer variable</mark>. Thus, a pointer is simply a variable that
   stores the address of some object in memory.
