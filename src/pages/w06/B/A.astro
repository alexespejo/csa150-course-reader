   Let's apply what you've learned about file I/O. Click on the "Running Man" to
   open CodeCheck in a separate window. Leave the window open as we work through
   the process of writing a function named
   <tt>searchFile()</tt> which takes two <tt>string</tt>
   arguments.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>The first argument is the <b>name of the file</b> to open</li>
   <li>The second argument is the <b>word or phrase to search for</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Neither <tt>string</tt> may be modified, and there is no return value. Here are
   the <mark>specifications</mark> for the function:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Open the file and <strong>read it line by line</strong>.</li>

   <li>
    If the phrase you are looking for is found in that line, then print the line
    number (in a field 5<strong> </strong>wide), a space, a colon, another space
    and then the line from the file, followed by a newline.
   </li>
   <li>Assume the first line number in the file is line #1.</li>
   <li>Your output should be printed with <tt>cout</tt>.</li>
   <li>
    If the file cannot be found, then print an error message (using <tt>cerr</tt
    >, of course): "File <em>fname</em> cannot be opened".
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Once you have the program opened, go to the next page, and we'll complete the <b
    >mechanics</b
   > of the function.
  </p>
 </div>
