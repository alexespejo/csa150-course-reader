   Value-Oriented or Object-Based programming involves creating new,
   user-defined types. There are four strategies for building a new type:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Build it <mark>completely from scratch</mark>, using only built-in
    components.
   </li>
   <li>
    Build it from scratch, but <mark
     >make use of the classes that others have written</mark
    > to do some of the work.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Combine simpler types</mark>
    to create complex types. This is <strong>composition</strong>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Extend</mark> a general class, adding new features. This is called <strong
     >inheritance</strong
    >.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <strong>Programming with inheritance</strong>
   is called <mark>Object Oriented Programming</mark>.
  </p>
  <p>These strategies express three kinds of "class relationships":</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The <mark>uses-a</mark> relationship, (or <mark>association</mark>), occurs
    when your class uses the services of other classes. For instance, if your
    class uses <tt>cout</tt> in one of your member functions, your class is dependent
    on the
    <tt>ostream</tt> class.
   </li>
   <li>
    The <mark>has-a</mark> relationship, says one class is a combination of other
    objects. In the <strong>has-a</strong>
    relationship one type is composed of different parts. A
    <tt>Bicycle</tt> class thus may contain two instances of the <tt>Wheel</tt> class.
   </li>
   <li>
    The <mark>is-a</mark> relationship, when one class is an extension or "kind of"
    another class. The <strong>is-a</strong> relationship occurs when members of
    one class are a <strong>subset</strong> of another class. The <b>is-a</b> relationship
    is implemented using
    <mark> public inheritance</mark>. In the relationship shown here, we'd say
    that a <tt>MountainBike</tt>
    <strong>is-a</strong>
    <tt>Bicycle</tt>.
