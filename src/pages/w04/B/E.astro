  <h1>Running Doxygen</h1>
 </Header><div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   If you are using the Codespaces IDE, you can see if Doxygen is installed by
   using the command: <tt>doxygen</tt>. If you see this:
  </p>
  <div class="consoleDisplay">
   doxygen<br />
   bash: doxygen: command not found
  </div>
  <p>then Doxygen is not installed in your instance. Install it like this:</p>
  <div class="consoleDisplay">
   <mark>sudo apt-get install doxygen</mark><br />
   Reading package lists... Done<br />
   ... more stuff ...<br />
   After this operation, 20.0 MB of additional disk space will be used. Do you want
   to continue? [Y/n]
  </div>
  <p>
   Type <mark>Y</mark> and press <tt>ENTER</tt> and it will be installed for your
   current session. Type <tt>doxygen</tt> again, and you'll see a list of the program's
   options. Here are the ones you want to use:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Type <tt>doxygen -g</tt> to generate a <mark>configuration file</mark> named
    <tt>Doxyfile</tt>. You can change its name if you like.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the configuration file, you might want to change these items. Just open
    it with your text editor, make the changes and save it.
   </li>
   <ul>
    <li>Change the Project Name to something appropriate</li>
    <li>Set <b>Brief Member Desc</b> to NO</li>
    <li>Set <b>Javadoc auto brief</b> to YES</li>
    <li>Set <b>Warn no param doc</b> to YES</li>
    <li>Set <b>Generate Latex</b> to NO</li>
    <li>Set <b>Have Dot</b> to NO</li>
   </ul>
   <li>
    Browse through the rest of the configuration file, and the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://doxygen.nl/manual/config.html"
     >online configuration help</a
    >, to further customize your configuration. Save the configuration file, so
    you don't need to reconfigure if you need to install Doxygen again.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   After you've created your configuration file, put it in the folder with your
   documented library files. Type the command
   <tt><mark>doxygen Doxyfile</mark></tt> and Doxygen will process your files and
   produce a new folder inside your project folder, named <tt>html</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
   To view your files (inside the CodeSpaces IDE), just type
   <tt>http-server</tt> in the terminal window and <b>Control-Click</b>
   the link that it provides you. Navigate to the <tt>index.html</tt>
   file in the <tt>html</tt> folder and click it, and you'll see the documentation
   for your library. When you're done looking at it, stop the <tt
    >http-server</tt
   > by typing <tt>Control-C</tt> in the terminal window.
