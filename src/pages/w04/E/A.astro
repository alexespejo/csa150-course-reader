  <h1>More Selection &amp; Iteration</h1>
 </Header><div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   We have covered the basics of selection, iteration and functions in C++, but
   here are several additional features you might to use:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The <tt>switch</tt> statement which provides an efficient multi-way branch based
    on the concept of an integer selector.
   </li>
   <li>
    The <b>conditional operator</b> which allows you to turn a 4-line
    <tt class="i">if-else</tt> statement into a single, compact, expression.
   </li>
   <li>
    The <tt class="i">do-while</tt>, (or <b>hasty</b>) loop, for when you want
    to leap before you look.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's take these in order.</p>
