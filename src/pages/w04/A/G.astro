  <h1>The Implementation File</h1>
 </Header><div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   Place your <mark>definitions</mark> in an
   <strong>implementation file</strong>. The
   <strong>implementation</strong>
   file has the same root or <strong>base name</strong> as the header file, but a
   different extension. You'll use <tt>.cpp</tt> in this class but other conventions
   include <tt>.cxx</tt>, <tt>.cc</tt>, and <tt>.C</tt> (a capital <strong
    >'c'</strong
   >).
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Create an <strong>implementation file</strong> using the extension
    <tt>.cpp</tt>.
   </li>
   <li>Add a file comment to the top of the file.</li>
   <li>
    <tt>#include</tt> the interface file for the library you are implementing.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you use other libraries, such as <tt>string</tt>, you should include them
    as well. This example does not.
   </li>
   <li>
    Add a <strong>using directive</strong> if you are using any library types. This
    library does not.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>Copy the prototypes</strong> from each of the functions in the header
    file into the implementation file. You don't need to bring across the documentation.
    Make sure, also, that you
    <mark>don't copy the header guards</mark>.
   </li>
   <li><strong><mark>Stub out</mark> each of the functions</strong>.</li>
   <p>
    This is <strong>purely mechanical</strong>. You want to practice it until it
    becomes second nature. You should <strong>memorize</strong> this part, so you
    don't have to expend any brain cells to complete it.
