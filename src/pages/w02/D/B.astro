 <Header id="B">String Input and Output</Header>
 <div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   You may use <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> to read and write <tt
    >string</tt
   > objects, like this:
  </p>
  <pre
   class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>cout &lt;&lt; "Enter your name: ";
string name;
cin &gt;&gt; name;
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "!" &lt;&lt; endl;</code></pre>
  <p>
   This version of the program reads a <tt>string</tt> input by the user into the
   variable <tt>name</tt> and then includes
   <tt>name</tt> as part of the greeting, as shown in the screenshots below:
   <img
    src={imageStringInput}
    class="inlineCenter width-90"
    alt="Three sample runs of the program."
   />
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>If the user enters only a first name, then all goes as you'd expect.</li>
   <li>
    However, the user enters a <strong>full name</strong> instead of just the first,
    only the first is read.
    <p>
     Even though the program contains no code to split the name apart, it
     somehow still uses <strong>only</strong> the first name when it prints its greeting.
     <p>
      Why? Because <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
      <strong>stops reading</strong> as soon as it sees the first <mark
       >whitespace character</mark
      >. A whitespace character is any character that appears as blank space on
      the screen, and includes the tab and newline characters.
     </p>
     <li>
      To read <strong>an entire line of text,</strong> use the
      <tt>string</tt> function <tt>getline()</tt> like this, in place of line 3:
      <pre
       data-start="3"
       class="language-cpp line-numbers"><code>getline(cin, name);</code></pre>
      <br />
      This <strong>reads an entire line</strong> from <tt>cin</tt> into the variable
      <tt>name</tt>. When run, the program allows you to display the full name
      of the user instead of just the first name.
     </li>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </div>
</Layout>
