   In previous example, both the <tt>if</tt>
   body and the <tt>else</tt> body contain a <mark>single statement</mark>, so
   braces <mark>are not required</mark>, even though I would recommend adding
   them. When you want to have a <strong>group of statements</strong> in place of
   a single statement, place those statements in a
   <mark>block</mark>, sometimes called a <mark>compound statement</mark>, which
   is a collection of statements enclosed in curly braces.
  </p>
  <p>
   The placements of braces and indentation are topics of "religious" fervor.
   You can read more about the "wars", and the different styles
   <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style"
    >on Wikipedia</a
   >.
  </p>
  <p>
   The most common styles are <strong>K&amp;R style</strong>, which places the
   opening brace on the same line as the header, and
   <strong>Allman</strong> (or <strong>ANSI</strong> or
   <strong>BSD</strong>) style, which places the opening brace on its own line.
  </p>
  <pre
   class="language-cpp"><code>// K&amp;R Formatted
cout &lt;&lt; "The number " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " is ";
if (nt % 2 == 0) &lbrace;
    cout &lt;&lt; "even." &lt;&lt; endl;
&rbrace; else &lbrace;
    cout &lt;&lt; "odd." &lt;&lt; endl;
&rbrace;</code></pre>
  <p>
   The K&amp;R style, shown here, is more compact, but, for me, the Allman style
   (which is what I normally use), is more readable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Statements inside of a block are usually <strong>indented</strong>. The
   compiler ignores the indentation, but the visual effect is helpful since it
   emphasizes the program structure when reading it. Empirical research has
   shown that <mark>indenting three or four spaces</mark> at each new level makes
   the program structure easiest to see; in CS150 I'll use four spaces for each new
   level.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indentation is critical to good programming, so you should strive to develop
   a consistent indentation style in your programs.
