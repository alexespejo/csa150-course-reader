  <h1>Writing Functions</h1>
  <p class="firstLine">
   Programs are composed of
   <mark>functions</mark>, which are, in turn, made up of
   <mark>statements</mark>. Functions are <mark>named blocks of code</mark>
   which carry out an action, or calculate a value. In a previous lesson you <strong
    >used</strong
   > math functions in <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt>, and I/O objects and functions
   from <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt>. Now you're going to write some of your own.
  </p>
  <p>Let's start with some vocabulary:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <mark>Declaring</mark>
    <strong> a function</strong>: specifying the function name, type and
    parameter types. Also called a <strong>prototype</strong>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Defining</mark>
    <strong>a function</strong>: specifying the calculations (or actions) that
    take place when the function is used. The actions are C++ <strong
     >statements</strong
    > that appear inside the
    <strong>body</strong> of the function, which is surrounded by curly braces.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Calling</mark>
    <strong>a function</strong>: executing, running or invoking the function.
    Write the name of the function, followed by a list of
    <strong>arguments</strong> enclosed in parentheses. This allows the <strong
     >caller</strong
    > to pass information to the function. When the function is done, it <strong
     >returns to the caller</strong
    >, possibly supplying a value.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Once a function has been defined, other parts of the program can run that
   code by using the function name; there is no need to repeat the code in
   different places.
  </p>
