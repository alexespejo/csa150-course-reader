 <Header id="C">The Function Body</Header>
 <div>
  <p class="firstLine">
   The <strong>body</strong> of the function is a <strong>block</strong>
   consisting of the <strong>statements</strong> that implement the function, along
   with the declarations of any local variables. For functions that <strong
    >return a value</strong
   > to their caller, at least one of those statements must be a <tt>return</tt>
   statement:
  </p>
  <pre class="language-cpp"><code>return expression;</code></pre>
  <p>
   Executing the <tt>return</tt> statement causes the function to immediately to
   return to its caller, passing back the value of the expression as the value of
   the function.
  </p>
  <p>
   Functions that return a value to their caller are called <mark
    >fruitful functions</mark
   >, because they
   <strong>can be treated as an operand in expressions</strong>. Functions can
   return values of any type. Once you have defined a fruitful function, it can
   be used <strong>as if it were a value</strong>. For instance, the <tt
    class="i">f2c</tt
   >
   program <mark>calls</mark>
   <tt>convert()</tt> like this:
  </p>
  <pre
   class="language-cpp"><code>double celsius = convert(temperature);</code></pre>
  <div>
   <p>
    In this case <tt>temperature</tt> is the
    <strong>argument</strong> that is used to initialize the <strong
     >parameter</strong
    >
    <tt>temp</tt>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Functions <strong>do not need to return a value</strong>. Such a function is
    often called a <mark>procedure</mark>. Procedures must have some kind of <strong
     >side-effect</strong
    >, such as printing, to be useful.
   </p>
   <p>
    To define a procedure, use <tt>void</tt> as the function's return type. Procedures
    ordinarily finish by reaching the end of the statements in the body, but you
    may leave the procedure early by executing a <tt>return</tt> statement by itself.
   </p>
   <h2>Two C++ Function Pitfalls</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Unlike Java and C#, <strong>unreachable</strong> code is not illegal. (It is
     a bug, though!)
    </li>
    <li>
     If you forget to add a <tt>return</tt> statement to a fruitful function, your
     code will still compile. The actual returned value will be random. This may
     cause your program to crash, or simply act erratically.
    </li>
   </ul>
