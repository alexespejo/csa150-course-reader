   Individual characters in C++ are represented by the built-in primitive data
   type named <tt>char</tt> (
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#char">
    usually pronounced
   </a>
   "tchar", not "kar"). In memory, these values are represented by assigning each
   character an 8-bit integer code called
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii">
    an ASCII code
   </a>. (Actually, only 7-bits are defined by C++, so the ASCII values 128-255
   are non-standard and may vary from platform to platform.)
  </p>
  <p>
   You write <mark>character literals</mark> by enclosing each character <strong
    >in single quotes</strong
   >. Thus, the literal
   <tt>'A'</tt> represents the internal code of the uppercase letter
   <b>A</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, C++ allows you to write <strong>special characters</strong> in a
   multi-character form beginning with a back-slash (<tt>\</tt>). This form is
   called
   <mark>an escape sequence</mark>. This includes the
   <strong>newline</strong> (<tt>\n</tt>), the <strong>tab</strong>
   (<tt>\t</tt>), and a double-quote inside a string literal (<tt>\"</tt>). Here
   is a list of
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape">
    the C++ escape sequences
   </a>.

  <h2>Character Functions</h2>
  <p>
   It is useful to have tools for working with individual characters. The
   <tt>&lt;cctype&gt;</tt> header contains a variety of
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cctype">
    functions that do that</a
   >. There are two kinds of functions.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <mark>Predicate classification functions</mark>
    test whether a character belongs to a particular category. Calling
    <tt>isdigit(ch)</tt> returns true if <tt>ch</tt> is one of the digit characters
    in the range between <tt>'0'</tt>
    and <tt>'9'</tt>. Similarly, <tt>isspace(ch)</tt>
    returns true if <tt>ch</tt> is any of the characters that appear as white space
    on a display screen, such as spaces and tabs.
   </li>
   <li>
    <mark>Conversion macros</mark>
    make it easy to convert between uppercase and lowercase letters. Calling <tt
     >toupper('a')</tt
    >, for example, returns the character <tt>'A'</tt>. If the argument is <strong
     >not</strong
    >
    a letter, the function returns it unchanged, so that
    <tt>tolower('7')</tt> returns <tt>'7'</tt>.
   </li>
  </ul>
