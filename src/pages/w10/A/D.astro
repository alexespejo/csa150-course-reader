<Layout

 <Header id="D">

  <p class="firstLine">
   When you're finished, type <tt>make</tt>
   <tt>run</tt> in the <b>Console</b> tab, and enter in some last names to search
   for. Here's what happens when I run the program.
   <img
    src={imageSequential}
    class="inlineCenter width-80"
    alt="Runnin sequential search."
   />
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    I start with <strong>Thompson</strong>, the <strong>first name</strong>
    in the file, so the program
    <strong>immediately finds and prints</strong> the answer, displaying only two
    "dots" before the answer.
   </li>
   <li>
    When I look for <strong>Gilbert</strong>, the program needs to look through
    a little more than half of the array before finding <strong
     >Roger Gilbert</strong
    >.
   </li>
   <li>
    When I look for <strong>Smith</strong>, surprisingly there are no Smiths in
    the directory. The program has to look through every single element before
    it can report the fact that it failed.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, what conclusions can we make from this experiment?</p>
