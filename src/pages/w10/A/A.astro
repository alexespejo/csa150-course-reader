   Searching is a big part of everyday life today. When a friend asks, "<em
    >Who was the actress who starred in the movie the Parent Trap?</em
   >" you're accustomed to having the answer at your finger tips. Out comes your
   phone and you ask Siri or Google or DuckDuckGo. How do they know the answer?
   The programs <mark>search for it</mark> among all of the pages on the Internet.
   (Of course, even Google can be wrong; I've never heard of Lindsay Lohan. It's
   supposed to be Haley Mills!).

   So, how does searching work? In this lesson, we'll look at two different techniques
   for searching a list of data, such as the data in an array. Start by clicking
   on the "running man" to open a <strong>Replit</strong> project called
   <strong>Searching</strong>.
   <img src={imageFork} class="inlineCenter shadow" alt="Forking the Repl." />
   <strong>Fork</strong> the project so that you have your own copy.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you open the project, click the plus sign to open a new tab in the
   editor and then click <tt>directory.txt</tt>
   to see the file that your program will process.
   <img
    src={imageReplitText}
    class="inlineCenter shadow"
    alt="The directory.txt file in the starter Repl."
   />
  </p>
  <p>
   The text file contains a directory of a thousand people, in random order.
   Each line has three fields: the <mark>name</mark>
   (in last, first order), the person's <mark>email</mark>, and their <mark
    >phone</mark
   > number. Each of the fields is separated by commas.
