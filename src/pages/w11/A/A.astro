   Depending on your operating system and C++ development environment used,
   there are different methods of starting a program. All of these methods
   ultimately rely on the operating system's facility to <mark
    >load and run a program</mark
   >.
  </p>
  <p>
   While you can write C++ code which calls these facilities directly, your IDE
   will normally make use of your operating system's
   <mark>command processor</mark>, also known as the <strong>shell</strong>.

  </p>
  <p>
   In Windows, the shell is usually the program named
   <tt>cmd.exe</tt>, although later versions of Windows come with a more
   powerful shell program called
   <b>Powershell</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Linux and on the Mac, the most popular shell program is
   <tt>bash</tt> (the
   <b>Bourne-again Shell</b>; a typical UNIX pun). That is the one we are using
   in our workspaces.
