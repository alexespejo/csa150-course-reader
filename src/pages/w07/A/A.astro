   One of the most influential authors in the C++ world is Scott Meyers. His <strong
    >Effective C++</strong

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "Forty years ago, goto-laden code was considered perfectly good practice.
    Now we strive to write structured control flows. Twenty years ago, globally
    accessible data was considered perfectly good practice. Now we strive to
    encapsulate data. Ten years ago, writing functions without thinking about
    the impact of exceptions was considered good practice. Now we strive to
    write exception-safe code.

    <em>Time goes on. We live. We learn."</em>

   In a perfect world, users would never mistype a URL, programs would have no
   bugs, disks would never fill up, and your Wi-Fi would never go down. We,
   however, don't live in a perfect world. You may wake up, planning to head off
   for school just like any other day, but sometimes,
   <mark>something unexpected appears at your front door</mark>.
